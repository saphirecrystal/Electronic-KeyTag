# Electronic-KeyTag
Purpose: Most of us keep our keys on a counter or hang them to a key-stand after use. Some of us, just throw them on a couch or leave them in pockets. In such cases it is easy to find keys when the attached key tag blinks or makes some noise.
 
 Other features: 
 Flash Light: The RGB lights on the Key â€“ Tag can be turned on using a switch button.
 Flash RGB LED's based on orientation of Key chain in XYZ planes.
 
 How to use the Key-Tag?
 Flash Light: single click to turn the flash light ON and single click to turn it OFF.
 
 Flash RGB according to XYZ: Hold the switch button down for more than two seconds and less than five seconds. 
 A Green LED will flash for a second to indicate the FANCY mode. 
 To see the lights flash according to orientation of Key Tag, accelerate the tag in each coordinate plane. 
 Standing fork lift -> Green LED
 Rotate fork lift 90 degrees -> Red LED
 Place flat down -> Blue LED
 To exit the fancy mode: long press for 2 to 5 seconds or single click twice.
 
 The Key chain will beep if it senses no acceleration for an hour continously. To stop the key chain from beeping and flasing lights  accelerate it once. The timer will reset everytime there is an acceleration.
 
 To shut it off and turn it back On, long press the switch button for more than 5 seconds and less than 10 seconds.
 
 One can program the Key-Tag circuit board using the MSP-FET: http://www.ti.com/tool/MSP-FET
 It can also be programmed through a TI evaluation board provided you have a programmar cable: http://www.tag-connect.com/TC2050-IDC-430
